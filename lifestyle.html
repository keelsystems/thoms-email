        I grew up as the overweight kid who could never quite make a diet stick. In university I finally cracked the code,
        dropped the weight, and found powerlifting. Then life happened and a lot of that slipped away.
      </p>
      <p class="sub-secondary">
        This page is where I write down the full story and the plan for round two. It’s for future me, my kids, and eventually

      <h2>The short version</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve basically always been the big kid. I played sports, I was active, and I tried to lose weight more than once,
        but nothing ever stuck. After first year university, I hit the point where “I’ll fix it someday” wasn’t good enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Someone pointed me to Scoobie’s Workshop calorie calculator. I started counting calories properly, learned what I was
        actually eating, and the weight came off. I went from around 265&nbsp;lb down to about 170&nbsp;lb, then moved into
        the gym, built muscle, and ended up competing in powerlifting at different weight classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually I fell off. Work, stress, family, and the usual life stuff pushed training and nutrition into the background.
        I’ve tried a few times to get back to that level and haven’t fully nailed it yet. This page marks the point where I’m
        drawing a line and deliberately building a version two that works with the life I have now.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Growing up always overweight</h2>
      <p>
        As a kid and teenager I was often moving: sports, walking, just being out of the house. But my default setting was still
        “overweight.” I tried a few diets and challenges along the way, but they were always short bursts followed by a slide
        back to normal habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The missing piece wasn’t effort. It was understanding how calories, macros, and consistency actually work, and having a
        system that didn’t rely on motivation alone.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>First big switch: discovering calories and lifting</h2>
      <p>
        After my first year of university I decided I was done feeling stuck. I found Scoobie’s Workshop, plugged in my numbers,
        and for the first time saw a sensible daily target instead of random diet rules.
      </p>
      <div class="callout">
        I tracked calories, paid attention to protein, and treated it like a problem to solve instead of a vague wish.
        The scale started moving and it kept moving because the plan was simple and measurable.
      </div>
      <p>
        Over time I dropped from roughly 265&nbsp;lb down to around 170&nbsp;lb. Once I realized I could actually change my body,
        I leaned into strength training and started spending serious time under the bar instead of just treating the gym as
        a place to burn calories.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>From weight loss to powerlifting</h2>
      <p>
        After getting lean, I shifted into building strength and muscle. That meant eating more on purpose, tracking things,
        and accepting that the scale going up wasn’t automatically a bad thing. Powerlifting became the way to channel that
        energy into something concrete.
      </p>
      <ul class="timeline">
        <li><strong>Bulk to ~200&nbsp;lb</strong> and build a base of strength.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut to ~163&nbsp;lb</strong> for a first powerlifting meet.</li>
        <li><strong>Bulk to ~183&nbsp;lb</strong> and compete again at nationals.</li>
        <li><strong>Bulk to ~205&nbsp;lb</strong> for another run at provincials.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        During that stretch I wasn’t just following a program. I was deep into the details: supplements, macros,
        micronutrients, recovery, and programming. If I had taken a slightly different path, I could easily have ended up as a
        personal trainer or strength coach.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Falling off and real life</h2>
      <p>
        At some point, the graph reversed. Work got heavier, responsibilities stacked up, and training became the thing that
        moved to “tomorrow” more often than not. Nutrition followed. None of it happened overnight; it was a slow drift away
        from the habits that had worked so well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve taken a few runs at getting back to that competition-ready version of myself, but trying to copy-paste old
        routines onto a new life hasn’t worked. Different job, different schedule, and now kids in the picture mean the
        approach has to change too.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Round two: doing it again, differently</h2>
      <p>
        For my own health and for my kids, it’s time to flip the switch again. The goal this time isn’t to recreate the exact
        numbers from my old meets. The goal is to build a sustainable system that keeps me strong, mobile, and in a body
        I’m proud of while still being present at home and at work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The good news: I already know what works. I understand calories, macros, training progression, and recovery. I know how
        to write a realistic plan and how to run it. The work now is about consistency and fitting that plan into the version
        of life I’m living today.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ll use this page as a place to keep my principles and high-level plan visible so I’m accountable to something more
        permanent than a note on my phone.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Helping other people, once I’ve proved it again</h2>
      <p>
        I’m not putting myself out there as a coach while I’m still rebuilding. First I want to demonstrate, again, that I can
        take myself from “fell off” back to strong, healthy, and consistent. Once I’ve done that, I’d like to open up some
        one-on-one capacity for regular people who want realistic training and nutrition help.
      </p>
      <p>
        That would likely look like straightforward, habit-first coaching: strength programs, simple nutrition targets, and
        check-ins that fit around real jobs and family life instead of pretending everyone lives in a gym.
